# Idea
There is basic map with few objects.
You need enter <sequence> of actions to collect every star.
You can't see step by step results, you need to think about 
whole path of your character.

Character \'\*\' - you can move it or use items on spot where you stand
Wall \'\#\' - you can't go throw wall.
Lever \'!\' - when you stands on this object you can use it to interract with 
another object
Star \'\*\' - simply collect this stuff
Door \'D\' - use lever to open it
